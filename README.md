## Usage

This configuration is intended to be used as a Docker-based development environment for both Magento 1 and Magento 2.

Folders:

- `images`: Docker images for nginx and php
- `compose`: sample setups with Docker Compose

Nginx assumes you are running Magento 2, however you can easily run it with Magento 1 using [the provided configuration file](https://github.com/markoshust/docker-magento/blob/master/images/nginx/1.13/conf/default.magento1.conf). Here is an [example of this setup with Docker Compose](https://github.com/markoshust/docker-magento/tree/master/compose/magento-1).

The PHP images are fairly agnostic to which version of Magento you are running. The PHP 5 images do assume you are running Magento 1, and the PHP 7 images do assume you are running Magento 2, however the main difference is cronjob setup, and they can be easily modified for inverse usage.

## Prerequisites

This setup assumes you are running Docker on a computer with at least 16GB RAM, a quad-core, and an SSD hard drive. [Download & Install Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download).

This configuration has been tested on Mac, but should also work on Mac, Windows and Linux.

If you are using a Mac, it is strongly recommended for you to apply [these performance tuning changes](http://markshust.com/2018/01/30/performance-tuning-docker-mac) to Docker for Mac before starting.

## Setup a New Magento 2 Project

1. Setup a new project using the Magento 2 compose skeleton:

Please note that the folder name ('magento2.test') will be used as the `base-url` for the installation and for setting up the db.env file.

```
mkdir magento2.test && cd $_
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:siven76/docker-magento.git
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/master -- compose/magento-2
mv compose/magento-2/* .
rm -rf compose .git
git init
```

2. Download the Magento source code to the `src` folder with: `./bin/download 2.2.2`

3. Setup your ip loopback for proper IP resolution with Docker: `./bin/initloopback`

4. Add an entry to `/etc/hosts` with your custom domain: `10.254.254.254 magento2.test` (assuming the domain  you want to setup is `magento2.test`). Be sure to use a `.test` tld, as `.localhost` and `.dev` will present issues with domain resolution.

5. Start your Docker containers with: `./bin/start`. This will create a db.env file on first run, based on the name of your folder (`magento2`) removing the `.test` part of the folder name.

6. Run Magento's setup install process with the command: `./bin/setup`. Feel free to edit this file to your liking; the `base-url` value will be taken from the folder name. Also, be sure to setup [Composer Authentication](https://github.com/markoshust/docker-magento#composer-authentication) before initiating the setup script.

7. You may now access your site at `http://magento2.test` (or whatever folder name your project is found in).

## Setup a New Magento 2 Project in Windows

1. Setup a new project using the Magento 2 compose skeleton:
(Run this with a bash-like terminal)
```
mkdir magento2 && cd $_
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:markoshust/docker-magento.git
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/master -- compose/magento-2-windows
mv compose/magento-2-windows/* .
rm -rf compose .git
git init
```

(The following scripts are meant to run with Powershell. Note that the execution policy for scripts needs to be set accordingly [Execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-executionpolicy?view=powershell-6))

2. Download the Magento source code to the `src` folder with: `./bin/download 2.2.2`. Note that the default untar command is quite slow. If you want to speed that up install [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) and add it to your PATH. The script will automatically use 7-Zip if it is available.

3. Copy magento into the docker container with `./bin/copymagento`. This is needed because of permission restrictions of shared data in Windows (see [Troubleshooting Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#permissions-errors-on-data-directories-for-shared-volumes)). The folders `app/code`, `app/design` and `app/i18n` will however be shared with Windows for ease of development. For these folders the default permission 755 works just fine.

4. Add an entry to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` with your custom domain: `127.0.0.1 magento2.test` (assuming the domain  you want to setup is `magento2.test`). Be sure to use a `.test` tld, as `.localhost` and `.dev` will present issues with domain resolution.

5. Start your Docker containers with: `./bin/start`.

6. Run Magento's setup install process with the command: `./bin/setup`. Feel free to edit this file to your liking; at the very least you will probably need to update the `base-url` value to the domain you setup in step 6. Also, be sure to setup [Composer Authentication](https://github.com/markoshust/docker-magento#composer-authentication) before initiating the setup script.

7. You may now access your site at `http://magento2.test` (or whatever domain you setup).


## Existing Magento Project Setup

See the `compose` folder for sample setups for both Magento 1 and Magento 2. Basically your source code should go in the `src` folder, and you can then kick your project off with `./bin/start`. You may have to complete a few of the steps above to get things functioning properly.

## Custom CLI Commands

- `./bin/bash`: Drop into the bash prompt of your Docker container. The `phpfpm` container should be mainly used to access the filesystem within Docker.
- `./bin/cli`: Run any CLI command without going into the bash prompt. Ex. `./bin/cli ls`
- `./bin/composer`: Run the composer binary. Ex. `./bin/composer install`
- `./bin/download`: Download a version of Magento to the `src` directory. Ex. `./bin/download 2.2.2`
- `./bin/fixperms`: This will fix filesystem ownerships and permissions within Docker.
- `./bin/initloopback`: Setup your ip loopback for proper Docker ip resolution.
- `./bin/magento`: Run the Magento CLI. Ex: `./bin/magento cache:flush`
- `./bin/setup`: Run the Magento setup process to install Magento from the source code.
- `./bin/start`: Start the Docker Compose process and your app. Ctrl+C to stop the process.
- `./bin/xdebug`: Disable or enable Xdebug. Ex. `./bin/xdebug enable`

## Misc Info

### Database

- The hostname of each service is the name of the service within the `docker-compose.yml` file. So for example, MySQL's hostname is `db` (not `localhost`) when accessing it from a Docker container.

### PHPStorm & Xdebug

First, enable Xdebug in the PHP-FPM container by running: `./bin/xdebug enable`, the restart the docker containers (CTRL+C, `./bin/start`).

Then, open `PHPStorm > Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > PHP` and configure:

- `CLI Interpreter`:
	- Create a new interpreter and specify `From Docker`, and name it `phpfpm`.
	- Choose `Docker`, then select the `markoshust/magento-php:7-0-fpm` image name, and set the `PHP Executable` to `php`.
	- Under `Additional > Debugger Extension`, enter
		- for M1: `/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20131226/xdebug.so`
		- for M2: `/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20160303/xdebug.so`
	- Hitting the reload executable button should find the correct PHP Version and Xdebug debugger configuration.

- `Path mappings`:
	- Don't do anything here as the next `Docker container` step will automatically setup a path mapping from `/var/www/html` to `./src`.

- `Docker container`:
	- Remove any pre-existing volume bindings.
	- Ensure a volume binding has been setup for Container path of `/var/www/html` mapped to the Host path of `./src`.

Open `PHPStorm > Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Debug` and set Debug Port to `9001`.

Open `PHPStorm > Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > PHP > DBGp Proxy` and set:

- IDE key: `PHPSTORM`
- Host: `10.254.254.254`
- Port: `9001`

Open `PHPStorm > Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Servers` and create a new server:

- Set Name and Host to your domain name (ex. `magento2.test`)
- Set Port to `8000`
- Check the Path Mappings box and map `src` to the absolute path of `/var/www/html`

Create a new `PHP Remote Debug` configuration at `Run > Edit Configurations`. Set the Name to your domain (ex. `magento2.test`). Check `Filter debug connection by IDE Key`, select the server of your domain name (ex. `magento2.test`), and set IDE key to `PHPSTORM`. The `Validate` functionality will most likely not work with the Docker container, but doesn't affect the ability to use Xdebug.

Open up `src/pub/index.php`, and set a breakpoint near the end of the file. Go to `Run > Debug 'magento2.test'`, and open up a web browser. Be sure to install a plugin like [Xdebug helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) which sets the IDE key to `PHPStorm` automatically for you. Enable the browser extension and activate it on the site, and reload the site. Xdebug within PHPStorm should now enable the debugger and stop at the toggled breakpoint.

### Composer Authentication

Please first setup Magento Marketplace authentication (details in the [DevDocs](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html)).

Place your auth token at `~/.composer/auth.json` with the following contents, like so:

```
{
    "http-basic": {
        "repo.magento.com": {
            "username": "MAGENTO_PUBLIC_KEY",
            "password": "MAGENTO_PRIVATE_KEY"
        }
    }
}
```
